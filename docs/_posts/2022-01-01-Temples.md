The following is some analysis of the temple data found on this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_temples_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints). The data were extracted into a table using this [online tool](https://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/).

## Temple construction time
The chart below illustrates the rate at which temples are started and completed after they are announced. As of 2021, the most recent year for which all temples announced in that year have been completed is 2012, and the most recent year for which all announced temples have been started is 2017. These data points suggest that there can be a delay of up to 4 years to groundbreaking from announcement, and another 5 years to dedication after groundbreaking. The average times for these are a little less than that, but more than 3 years in both cases. On the other hand, ground has already been broken on a handful of temples announced in both 2020 and 2021.

## Size of temples over time
The chart below shows the size (in square feet) of every temple built since 1950. The largest, Los Angeles, at over 190,000 square feet is by far the largest temple built since its completion. Only the Salt Lake temple is larger (250,000 square feet), but it includes a good deal of space that is not used as a temple in the way that the others are.

The pattern over time has been a steady decline in size of temples, even well before the advent of the "mini temple" that was built in large numbers starting in 1998. Only a handful of temples larger than 100,000 square feet have ever been built, with the most recent one Mt. Timpanogos in the 1990s. The most common size of a temple is 10,700 square feet, based on a design introduced in 1998 and still used frequently to this day. At this time a total of 32 temples are this size. For comparison, a typical church meetinghouse in North America is around 15,000 square feet. Almost no temples larger than 40,000 square feet have been built outside the mountain west (Utah, Idaho, and Arizona) in the last 20 years. So, while the number of new temples announced has increased substantially in the last few years, particularly since Russell M. Nelson became president of the church, most of them are much smaller than the temples of the past. This detail is significant when examining how much the temple building program might cost.

## Construction cost
In order to estimate construction costs of the temple building program, the primary reference points are the size of the structure in square feet, and the size of the land. In quite a few cases for the most recently announced temples, these data points are missing, so they must be filled in with educated guesses in order to get the most realistic cost estimate.

Guessing temple and lot sizes was done with the following assumptions:
 - nearly all temples outside the US, particularly Africa and Asia, are assumed to be 10,000 square feet, based on construction patterns in those regions in the last 20 years.
 - a handful of temples were assumed to be slightly larger, either 20,000 or 30,000 square feet if they were near large population centers in countries with relatively large numbers of church members, based on typical sizes of existing temples in those countries. This includes several temples in various South American countries. Fort Worth, Texas and Rexburg North, Idaho were also put in this mid-size category due to their relative proximity to existing temples.
 - The Heber Valley, Utah temple was assumed to be 40,000 square feet based on sizes of temples in other parts of Utah with similar population.
 - Announced temples in Russia and China have been omitted due to ongoing uncertainty over whether they are likely to be built any time soon.
 - Land sizes were set at 3, 6, or 10 acres depending on the temple size, in line with patterns in the data for existing temples.

The two key assumptions for computing costs were a land price of US \\$500,000 per acre. This one is a bit of a wild guess, and turns out to be a not particularly consequential portion of the overall cost. The key value is the construction cost per square foot. In the US, commercial construction costs can run a few hundred up to \\$1000 per square foot. Temples are typically built to a relatively high grade, so we choose the high end of that range at \\$1000. We assume that the church is paying for construction directly without borrowing, and that the construction costs are amortized roughly equally over the construction period. If groundbreaking was 2012 and dedication in 2015, the cost per square foot is divided by 4 and allocated to the years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. This is all very rough, but tends to average out any estimation errors with the larger volume of construction projects during the last 20 years.

A great many projects have been announced in the last few years and not been completed or in some cases even started. In order to project future costs, for those cases the average time to groundbreaking and from groundbreaking to construction for temples completed in the last 20 years have been used to compute placeholder start and completion dates. This puts the completion of some of the temples announed in 2021 into 2027 and 2028.

The results of these calculations are shown in the chart below. By applying the same cost assumptions over time, we are effectively calculating costs in inflation-adjusted 2021 dollars. From these results we can see that most of the time from about 1980 to the present, the annual expenditure was between US \\$100 million and \\$200 million in most years, with the exception of the mini-temple construction surge in 1998-1999, and a new similar surge that began last year. In both cases those surges of construction led to expenditures in the \\$300-400 million range. The current construction boom is signficant, but because so many of the new temples are likely to be the very small ones, the total annual expenditure is in line with the last construction boom, though it is likely to stay high for several more years.

To compare this total to the church's annual operating costs (in 2021 dollars), we use $7 billion as an estimate of the operating costs of the church. At that number, temple construction has been about 2-3% of annual operating costs since 2000, but briefly went as high as 5% in 1999 and appears likely to do so again in the coming years with the recent surge of announcements.
