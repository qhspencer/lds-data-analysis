This is a blog containing some data analysis essays using the code in the
[lds-data-analysis](https://github.com/qhspencer/lds-data-analysis) git
repository. All of the entries were originally created are created as notebooks
using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Original source code for each notebook is
found in the
["notebooks"](https://github.com/qhspencer/lds-data-analysis/tree/master/notebooks)
subdirectory and were converted to web format using
[nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The notebooks can also
be viewed with their original source code using the
[nbviewer tool](http://nbviewer.org/github/qhspencer/lds-data-analysis/tree/master/notebooks/),
and clicking on the "show/hide" source code button at the end of the page.

I'm open to collaboration to add to this work, so feel free to
[contact me](https://github.com/qhspencer).
